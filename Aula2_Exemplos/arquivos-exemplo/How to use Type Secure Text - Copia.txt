SecureString is a string type that provides a measure of security. It tries to avoid storing potentially sensitive strings in process memory as plain text. The value of an instance of SecureString is automatically protected using a mechanism supported by the underlying platform when the instance is initialized or when the value is modified. Your application can render the instance immutable and prevent further modification by invoking the MakeReadOnly method.
